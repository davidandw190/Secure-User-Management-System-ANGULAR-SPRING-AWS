* *BACK-END*: [CHECK OUT THE PROGRESS HERE](https://github.com/davidandw190/Secure-User-Management-Portal-BACKEND)
* *FRONT-END*:

## Project Overview:

This is a personal project that I am very excited for and that aims to to simulate real-life usage scenarios while being both robust and secure. 

The reason for building it is to gain a proper fundamental knowledge of frameworks like Spring and Angular, to further familiarise myself with languages like Typescript, and to explore diverse projects and libraries from these areas in order to deepen my effectiveness in the area of fullstack development. And, of course, for the challange too! ^-^

## Project Features:

### User Authentication and Authorization:
- User validation, authentication, and authorization via JSON Web Tokens (JWT) using Spring Security.
- Password encryption and decryption using BCryptPasswordEncoder.

### Role-based Access Control:
- Implementation of role-based access control with different user roles (Super Admin, Admin, HR, User).
- Restricted access to certain functionalities based on user authorites provided by roles.

### Data Persistence:
- Use of Spring Data JPA with MySQL for data persistence to handle scalability and smooth integration with other systems.

### Advanced Security Measures:
 - Implementation of advanced security measures to prevent brute force attacks and enable secure CRUD operations, file upload, and email sending.
 
### Front-end UI:
- Use of Angular for the front-end UI, providing an intuitive and responsive user interface.

### Integration with External APIs:
- Integration with additional external APIs for added functionality and convenience.

### Deployment:
- Deployment of the project on AWS Cloud Platform for seamless and scalable usage.
